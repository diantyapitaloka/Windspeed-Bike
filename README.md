- Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic.
- Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position.
- Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles.
- Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.
- Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research.
- Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems.
- This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city.
- Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.
